exampleLeftHand.blend is a blender file that can be uses as a starting point for your own hands. In particular it has the bones in the correct places.

Like everything else in this project exampleHand.blend is bsd-3 licenced. That means you can use the mesh in it as a starting point for your own hands; that is absolutely intended usage.

Note that the example has a subsurface modifier; this means the number of edit verticies are kept small, but the number of render verticies is high; this makes editing less painful.

Note that on export you must check +Y up to get it compatible with JME.
